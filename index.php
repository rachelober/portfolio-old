        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This site includes all of my personal and academic artwork and programs. 
          In the future I may add writings to my projects but right now this site 
          showcases the type of work I have done throughout my high school years. 
          =)</p>
        <p>This site utilizes not only php scripts, but javascript and MySQL databases 
          as its main structure. I have developed this site to run a gallery script 
          I have written myself to search through the database to retrive certain 
          catagories whenever you pick a link to the right and will load the page 
          according to the criteria.</p>
        <p>I specifically put all of my work up (provided I have scanned or photographed 
          it) even if it is not my best work because I believe everything I have 
          done has helped me succeed elsewhere; it also shows the progress I have 
          made through the days, months and years since I began.</p>
        <p>Right now everything but my Php scripts and Introduction to Art pages 
          are up, so please feel free to look around!</p>
