      <p align="left"><b>Mintkiss.net: Memories Are Designed to Fade</b><br>
        <b>Date</b>: April ? - August 9, 2001<br>
        <b>Comments</b>: This site took me a while to get up...so that's why the 
        date is unknown of when I actually *got* it up. This layout features images 
        from Tonystone.com and goes through different &quot;stages&quot; so to 
        speak that I think involve life. The tree- being living itself and the 
        growth of people; the child- the innocence of thought; the young girl 
        crying- the hurt in life; the separating hands- the separation of younger 
        verses old, time versus eternity as well as the distances we go through 
        to achieve dreams; and finally the standing water glass of serenity, when 
        we find peace.</p>
      <p>&quot;Memories were designed to fade&quot; came from a song by my favorite 
        band, Savage Garden. It is a little less known song, but if you are a 
        big fan like me, you should definitely know this one. ^_~</p>

        <b>Date</b>: August 9, 2001 - September 29, 2001<br>
        <b>Comments</b>: This version presents my lovely puppy, (well...not quite 
        a puppy anymore) Lily! I have had her for almost 3 years now and I feel 
        she is my baby. ^_~ I love taking care of her, feeding and brushing her 
        and all that good stuff that comes with being a &quot;parent&quot;. I 
        found some photos of her while digging through my album collection and 
        decided since I was out of inspiration, I would use her (who usually ends 
        up being my inspiration for most things anyways... *lol*).</p>

      <p><b>Mintkiss.net: Fall into Autumn</b><br>
        <b>Date</b>: September 30, 2001 - December 2001<br>
        <b>Comments</b>: I so desperately loved using my own photos but the quality 
        of the pictures were never that great and it always took so long to get 
        the film developed. On my birthday, my dad bought me a Toshiba PDR-M61 
        so that I may take my own photographs to upload to the computer and digitally 
        manipulate to my liking. </p>
      <p>For this layout I used a photo of my backyard from a week or so ago before 
        the leave started to fall. For the summer, my younger sisters, my dad 
        and I spent weekends out in the yard pulling weeds and fixing it up real 
        nice. We worked in the yard for days to finish what we wanted, now this 
        picture celebrates that and maybe is the turning point in our lives for 
        new and better things that we have been missing. </p>

      <p align="left"><b>Mintkiss.net: a MINT kiss from a red rose</b><br>
        <b>Date</b>: December 2001 - February 22, 2002<br>
        <b>Comments</b>: I used my digital camera yet again in this layout to 
        capture a few of my mother's roses that she received from my dad on their 
        20th aniversary at the end of November. They certainly surprised her when 
        they showed up at the door one day in a pretty bunch. In the light of 
        the family room, the roses caught my eye and I decided to take the opportunity 
        and photo the lovely roses before they wilted. It took some posing, but 
        I got a couple good shots of them, and pick the best to use for this layout. 
        I used layers all over the place to get the kind of layout I desired. 
      <p>Before I could remember to take a snap shot, I overwrote it with the 
        newer layout! Silly me, but at least I still had the images from the layout 
        to make a psuedo-screenshot!</p>

        <b>Comments</b>: A picture of the wonderful AL the bonsai. Here he is 
        with flash animation and a neat little design used with it. My dad commented 
        that all the little green things were the bugs that infected all our plants 
        this year and spawned flies. ~__~*</p>
